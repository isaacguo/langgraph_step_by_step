# Project 7: Observability

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to add observability to LangGraph applications through logging and tracing, enabling better debugging, monitoring, and performance analysis.

## Concepts Covered
- Logging patterns in nodes
- Structured logging with context
- Performance logging
- Distributed tracing
- Execution monitoring
- Debug information collection

## Files
- `01_logging.py` - Logging patterns for LangGraph applications
- `02_tracing.py` - Tracing execution flow and performance

## Running Examples

```bash
conda activate arxiv-paper
cd project_7_observability
python 01_logging.py
```

## Prerequisites
- Complete Projects 1-6
- Understanding of logging best practices
- Knowledge of performance monitoring concepts

## Key Learning Points
- Implementing comprehensive logging in graph nodes
- Using structured logging for better analysis
- Tracking performance metrics across nodes
