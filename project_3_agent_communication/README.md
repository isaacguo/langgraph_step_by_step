# Project 3: Agent Communication

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to create and coordinate multiple agents in LangGraph, including basic multi-agent systems, supervisor patterns, and agent roles and responsibilities.

## Concepts Covered
- Multi-agent systems
- Agent roles and specialization
- Agent communication patterns
- Supervisor pattern
- Parallel agent execution
- Sequential agent workflows

## Files
- `01_basic_multi_agent.py` - Basic multi-agent system with different agent roles
- `02_supervisor_pattern.py` - Supervisor pattern for coordinating multiple agents

## Running Examples

```bash
conda activate arxiv-paper
cd project_3_agent_communication
python 01_basic_multi_agent.py
```

## Prerequisites
- Complete Projects 1-2
- Understanding of agent-based architectures
- Knowledge of state graphs and conditional edges

## Key Learning Points
- Designing specialized agent roles (researcher, writer, reviewer, etc.)
- Coordinating multiple agents in a workflow
- Implementing supervisor patterns for agent orchestration
- Managing state across multiple agents
- Creating parallel and sequential agent execution patterns
